# Welcome to @inuinsane PDF Tool


#### This app is only useful to help Formal Education Management staff in PT PLN (Persero) PUSDIKTAL to manage their pdf files


### Features 
- [x] Split pdf file into some files
- [x] Rename those splitted files according to an excel list


### How to use
1. Please note that you have installed python in your PC
2. You need to install ``pyinstaller`` package using this command
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
3. Compile this ```main.py``` file to an exe app so all of your friends can use this app without installing python on their PC by using this command
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile main.py
    ```
4. **Please note** that you might have errors while executing that command. One of the best solution I can give is to temporary disable your *windows defender* or antivirus. But if that solution didn't help you, you can just use the internet to help yourself.

### **Thanks**
